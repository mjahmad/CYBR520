    "#    _Example_: `\"example.exe\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **`number_of_sections`**: The count of sections in the PE file. Malware might have an unusual number of sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    _Example_: A typical PE file might have sections like `.text`, `.data`, `.rdata`, etc. An unusually high number might be suspicious.\n",

    "# 3. **`average_entropy`**: Entropy is a measure of randomness or complexity. High entropy can indicate encryption or packing, common in malware to evade detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    _Example_: An entropy value close to 8 might suggest encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **`number_of_imports`**: The number of imported functions. Malware often uses certain API calls that are rare in benign software.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    _Example_: A high number of system-level operations might be a red flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **`number_of_exports`**: The number of exported functions. Unusual export patterns can be indicative of malicious intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    _Example_: Malware designed as a DLL might export suspicious functions.\n",

    "# 19. **`size_of_headers`**: The combined size of the PE headers and the section table, indicating how much space the headers take.\n",
